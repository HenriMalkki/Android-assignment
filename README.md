# What's it for?
This relatively simple Android app was made as a school assignment. It was mostly meant for practicing what we had learned about Android programming, so functionality was the main focus.
It got the maximum grade possible for the assignment.

# What it does
<p>It's meant to be an app that helps organize voluntary work. Users can register an account and after logging in they can view a list of
tasks that need to be completed. Users can also change their own information, or delete their accounts.
They can then choose to take some tasks on and set them as started after which other users can't see
those tasks. They can also mark the task as completed, which will include a time stamp of the completion time.</p> 

<p>Only administrators (those organizing the voluntary work) can set new tasks and delete old ones. They can write a short description for it and a select a 
location from a map using the Google Maps API. It's a bit finnicky, but it works. Otherwise the location for the task will be their current
location data taken from their phones GPS. </p>

<p>The location for a task is mostly there for notifying the user about a task that is close by to their location. The distance under which the
notification will be sent can be modified from the settings tab.</p>
